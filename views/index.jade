            In this example, we have a constant ongoing process that Node is monitoring. For our purposes,
            we are just going to simulate stock prices. Now instead of the user initiating the request
            for an update, we are going to broadcast updates to all clients from the server side using
            Socket.IO. This keeps all connected client browsers in sync, irregardless of when the client
            connects to the server (of course, not taking into account network latency).
            
         p Stock prices will decay once started, and can be increased by 'buying' more stock.
